        <h4 class="space-grotesk">My Hobbies</h4>
        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is writing. I mostly write fantasy and horror stories. Going along with that, I also like to read. Like with my writing, I mostly read fantasy with sprinkles of other genres such as science fiction, horror, and romance. Another hobby of mine is playing video games, some of interest being "Genshin Impact", "Elden Ring", and "The Legend of Zelda".</p>
